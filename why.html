		<p>There's obviously the simple answer of "I'm required to take an elective", but here are a few reasons why I took this class:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I have some experience. I have had to learn some HTML for other classes.</li>
			<li>I find that knowing how to design a basic webpage is a great tool for ANYONE to have being in the job market.</li>
			<li>I really want to learn more than HTML. I dabbled a bit in CSS and Javascript, but I didn't really have the time to learn it properly. </li>
		</ol>

		<p>I did a really cool project for 362 Intro to Software Engineering, and we used Django to implement our frontend and backend. The project made me realize that web development encompasses way more than making a website look 'pretty', and it takes alot of knowledge, experience, and effort to create a website that is properly functional and visually appealing</p>
